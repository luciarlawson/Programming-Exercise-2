                <p>In my personal time, I am very passionate about a variety of sports and activities. 
                    One of my main interests is volleyball, which I’ve been playing for around three years. 
                    This interest continues to fuel my passion for sport and need to stay active. It not only 
                    offers a sense of personal fulfilment but also teaches me patience, discipline, and leadership.

            <div class="col-sm-6">
                <p>Another interest I have is in general crafting projects. I often dedicate weekends or evenings 
                    to random "mini projects", as it gives me a chance to disconnect from the hustle and connect with 
                    something meaningful. Through this hobby, I've developed my creative skills and learned how to 
                    use what I have even if it isn't perfect for the job. I spent a lot of time "crafting" with 
                    paracord making things like bracelets, keychains, belts and lanyards. I also spent an evening 
                    learning how to crochet an octopus. One of my bigger projects was making an incubator and 
                    hatching quail eggs from it. I have also started a scrapbook of places I have visited and 
                    learned how to make flowers from pipe cleaners among other things.

        <div class="row">
            <div class="col-sm-6">
                <p>I also enjoy kayaking and calisthenics which both keep me physically active and continuously 
                    learning. I’m was fascinated by learning how to do a roll in a kayak when I first joined the 
                    club. Learning how to was definitely a great way to challenge myself. Calisthenics challenges 
                    me more mentally as I have to fight against my body in order to complete the exercises.

            <div class="col-sm-6">
                <p>Beyond those core interests, I make time for other things like walking, bike rides, skimboarding, 
                    surfing, swimming, diving, and general sea bases activities. I find these activities to be both 
                    relaxing and rewarding. They allow me to explore new perspectives, appreciate the world around 
                    me, and find joy in the little things.
