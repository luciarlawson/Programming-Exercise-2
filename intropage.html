                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>Hi, my name is Lucia, and I am currently in my first year studying Computing Science and 
                    Mathematics at The University of Aberdeen. I took maths, computing, physical education and 
                    woodwork in my last year at school. In my spare time I enjoy volleyball, kayaking, and 
                    calisthenics and I have joined the university societies for each of these. To help fund my 
                    degree I have a job with Sport Aberdeen as a lifeguard.
                </p>

            <div class="col-sm-6">
                <p>Before moving to Aberdeen for University I lived in North Berwick. I went to Law Primary
                    School and then North Berwick High School. I was born in Glasgow and lived there for 7 
                    years of my life. I can't remeber much about Glasgow because I was quite young when we 
                    moved howeven I do remember thinking it was too busy and loud! I much prefer North 
                    Berwick where my parents house is. I t is a quiet costal town with lots of things to 
                    do as a child and a younger teenager. I am enjoying my time in Aberdeen so far but 
                    I would still rather be back at home in my small town.

                <h2>More About Me</h2>
                <p>In the future I hope to continue with all my sports and hobbies and enjoy my time at
                    university. Next year I am hoping to join the rugby club and start surfing in aberdeen.
                    I have many travel plans for my tme at university. This summer I am going to a
                    childrens summer camp in Canada as a lifeguard and kayak instructor. I will be away
                    for 11 weeks so hopffuly I come back with a really good tan!
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-sm-6">
                <p>In terms of my future career I am still very undesided. I have wanted to join the
                    RAF as a helicopter pilot for as long as I can remember but the application proccess 
                    has been so long (two years and still going!) and I think I have been out off by it.
                    I think after university I might do some vocational work or maybe a ski season before 
                    I settle into a lifelong career. Once I have finnished university I will probably have
                    a better idea of what I would like to do in life. For now I will just keep doing what
                    I'm doing and hope for the best.
